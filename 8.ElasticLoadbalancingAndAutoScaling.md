## Load Balancer

---

- load balancer is an end point
- single end end point for your program
- run multiple ec2 instance, with health check

* Application Load Balancer, HTTP/HTTPS
  - application level
* Network Load Balancer, TCP,TLS,UDP,TCP_UDP

  - high performance
  - network level

* elastic load balancing
  - ELB distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets
  - in a single AZ multiple AZ

## Auto scaling

---

- when instance fails a health check a new instance will be launched
- auto scaling can also be triggered when looking at cpu usage (> x%)
- EC2 auto scaling horizontal scaling

- how can a company enable elasticity for an application running EC2: amazon ec2 auto scaling
- which type of elastic load balancer can direct traffic based on domain name: application load balancer
- how does ec2 auto scaling assist wth cost-effectiveness: launching and terminating instances as demand changes
- how does elastic load balancing assist with fault tolerance: by distributing connections to multiple back-end instance
- which is incorrect about elastic load balancing: ELB can distribute across region
- what does elb use to ensure instances are available: health check
- which type of elb routes connections based on IP protocol at layer 4: network load balancer
- what type of template is used by amazon EC2 auto scaling to define instance family, ami key pair and security group: launch configuration
