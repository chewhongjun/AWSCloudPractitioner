EC2 = Amazon Machine Image (Linux, windows) = virtual hardware

Amazon EC2 Overview
--------------------------------------
- elastic compute cloud
- compute instance in the cloud
- choose physical configuration of the ec instsance



Amazon Machine Image(AMI)
--------------------------------------
- AMI provides the information required to launch an instance
- AMI is backed by an EBS snapshot or root volume(instance-store-backed AMI) 


Amazon EC2 Instance Types
--------------------------------------
- General compute
- compute optimized
- memory optimized
- accelerated computing
- storage optimized


Instance User Data and Instance MetaData
--------------------------------------
- User Data
- Data that you enter at the start of launch time
- not encrpyted
- Metadata
- find out information, region, az ip can be found on the instance meta data


AWS Lambda
--------------------------------------
- AWS Lamdba is a serverless computing technology that allows you to run without managing sever
- Lambda executes code only when needed and scales
- pay for what you consume
- No sever to manage, continous scaling, subsecond metering

Choosing the right service
--------------------------------------
1. IaaS (EC2)
2. CaaS (ECS)
3. FaaS (lambda)

For ec2 you have to manage the operating system.
ECS manage the containers
Lambda you manage the code

EC2-> scale vertically
ECS-> scale cluster
Lambda-> scales concurrent executitions

payment
EC2-> pay for instance run time
ECS-> pay for container run time
lamdba-> pay per execution

Exam Cram
--------------------------------------
- EC2
    - elastic compute cloud, elastically increase and decrease instances.
    - controlled by you completely
    - flexible cloud hosting, instance type,hardware,software,os, ram hdd
- AMI
    - amazon machine image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance
    - AMI include 1 or more EBS, OR instance-store-back AMI
    - block device mapping specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when its launched
    - 3 category, community ami, aws marketplace ami, my ami
- User Data
    - script that runs at the start of each instance
    - no encrpted
- Meta Data
    - data of the instance type
- Amazon ECS
    - high performance container management services
    - portable
    - 2 launch types, EC2 & Fargate
- AWS Lambda
    - severless computing technology, allow you to run code without provisioning sever
    - pay for the compute time you use
    - cost effective
- Amazon Lightsail
    - Provision virutal servers 
    - good for those without aws expertise

- What is a benefit of amazon EC2 compared to traditional severs, you can scale elastically quickly
- How can you run command son EC2 at launch time, user data
- which service allows you to run docker containers on AWS, Amazon ECS
- Which is considered a serverless service, AWS Lambda
- good for compute workloads for people without technical expertise in aws, Amazon lightsail
- Amazon Machine Images (AMI) are used for launching amazon EC2 instance
- not a benefit of AWS lambda, multiple instance types to choose from
- which storage service is useed by Amazon EC2 for root volume, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
