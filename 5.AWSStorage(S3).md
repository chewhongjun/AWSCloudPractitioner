AWS Storage Systems
--------------------------------------
Amazon S3 (object storage system)
- each object is store retrived and modified via a REST API
- it connects to a particular url
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Block system)
- EC2 instance can connect to a HDD/SSD
- within an AZ, availablity zone 
Amazon Elastic File System
- NFS mount point 
- allow remote access


Amazon S3
--------------------------------------
- unstructure
- using REST API
- unlimited scalability
- object based storage system
- object can be uploaded to a bucket
- S3 can be access via the public internet
- S3 is built to store and retrive any of data
- any type of file
- backup and storage
- host application
- media hosting
- files are stored in buckets
- bucket are root level folders
- s3 is a universal namespace, names must be globally unique
- however buckets are stored within a REGION
- Pricing
    - Storage
    - request
    - store management
    - data transfer pricing
- storage classes
    - s3 standard
    - s3 intelligent tiering
    - s3 standard-ia
    - s3 one-zone-ia
    - s3 glacier
    - s3 glacier deep archive
- Additional features
    - Transfer acceleration
    - requester pays
    - tags (objects used in biling)
    - events (lambda, sns)
    - static web hosting
    - bit torrent
- versioning
    - keep all versions, and changes
    - delete objects you can maintain your files
- Replication
    - Cross-region replication, replicate the files in your bucket, to another bucket in different region
    - same-region replicatiion, with different acount
- Access Amazon S3 bucket via EC2 via IAM Roles
    - this is safer rather than giving access keys to ec instance

Amazon Elastic block store
--------------------------------------
- Data is stored and managed in blocks within sectors
- block storage appears as local disk
- can be used as boot volume
- EBS access by the instance has to be in the same AZ(avail zone)
- 1 EBS can only have 1 Instance, 1 instance can have multiple EBS
- you can terminate instance and maintain EBS
- termination protection can be setup
- EBS snapshot, can be used to move between AZ
- instance store, high performance, physically attached to the host


Amazon Elastic File System
--------------------------------------
- file-based-storage system
- can be mounted via network, allowing read and write
- protocols include NFS, CIFS/SMB
- EFS can only be mounted to linux machines


AWS Storage Gateway
--------------------------------------
- hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on prem access to cloud storage
- low latency using cache



Exam cram
--------------------------------------
S3 
- duarbility-> 11 9's
- file stored in buckets
- media hosting
- static site hosting
- file 0-5TB
- unlimited storage
- universal name space, bucket
- bucket create in a region
- pricing, [storage, request, storage managemnt]
- S3 standard, s3 intellegient-tiering, s3 standard-ia, s3 one-zone ia, s3 glacier, s3 galcier dep archieve
- s3 features, transfer acceleration, requester pays, tag, events,static site hosting, bit torrent
- verision to maintain vari ant of an object
- Replication, cross-region, same-region

Elastic block store (EBS)
- persistent
- ebs automatically replicated within az
- ebs lives independent of its instance
- you cannot attach a single EBS volume to multiple instance
- EBS snapshot, capture point-in-time, not granular,
- EBS can use SSD or HDD
- instance store volume, high performance local disk, temp high speed

Elastic File System (EFS)
- EFS fully managed service service
- use NFS
- good for data analytic, media processing, content management, web
- data store across multiple az
- read after write consistency
- pay for what you use
- scaleable, elastic
- concurrent 1 to 1000 ec instance from multiple AZ
- 

AWS storage gateway
- hybrid storage gateway, hybrid cloud storage, on-prem access to cloud storage
- tape , file gateway (SMB,NFS, S3 api)
